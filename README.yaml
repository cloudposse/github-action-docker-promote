# How to use this project
usage: |-
  ### Promote a docker image to specific tag
  
  ```yaml
    name: Release
    on:
      release:
        types: [published]
    
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: write
    
    jobs:
      promote:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Docker image promote
            uses: cloudposse/github-action-docker-promote@main
            id: promote
            with:
              registry: registry.hub.docker.com
              organization: ${{ github.event.repository.owner.login }}
              repository: ${{ github.event.repository.name }}
              login: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
              password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD }}
              from: sha-${{ github.sha }}
              to: ${{ github.event.release.tag_name }}
              use_metadata: false
  
        outputs:
          image: ${{ steps.promote.outputs.image }}
          tag: ${{ steps.promote.outputs.tag }}  
  ```
    
  ### Promote a docker image to tags detected from metadata
  
  Promote action use [Docker Metadata action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/docker-metadata-action) under the 
  hood and can detect `to` tags based on Git reference and GitHub events. 
  
  ```yaml
    name: Pull Request
    on:
      pull_request:
        branches: [ 'main' ]
        types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, closed, labeled, unlabeled]

    jobs:
      context:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
  
          - name: Checkout
            uses: actions/checkout@v3
            with:
              fetch-depth: 2
  
          - name: Get previous commit
            id: prev-commit
            run: echo "sha=$(git rev-parse --verify HEAD^1)" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

          - name: Docker image promote
            uses: cloudposse/github-action-docker-promote@main
            id: promote
            with:
              registry: registry.hub.docker.com
              organization: ${{ github.event.repository.owner.login }}
              repository: ${{ github.event.repository.name }}
              login: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
              password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD }}
              from: sha-${{ steps.prev-commit.outputs.sha }}
              use_metadata: true
  
        outputs:
          image: ${{ steps.promote.outputs.image }}
          tag: ${{ steps.promote.outputs.tag }}  
  ```

  ### Promote a docker image with `from` fetched from metadata

  If you skip `from` tag then it would be populated as SHA of the current commit in long format.
  
  ```yaml
    name: Release
    on:
      release:
        types: [published]

    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: write

    jobs:
      promote:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Checkout
            uses: actions/checkout@v3
  
          - name: Docker image promote
            uses: cloudposse/github-action-docker-promote@main
            id: promote
            with:
              registry: registry.hub.docker.com
              organization: ${{ github.event.repository.owner.login }}
              repository: ${{ github.event.repository.name }}
              login: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
              password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD }}
              ## `from` is long SHA
              to: ${{ github.event.release.tag_name }}
              use_metadata: true

        outputs:
          image: ${{ steps.promote.outputs.image }}
          tag: ${{ steps.promote.outputs.tag }}  
  ```
